# IRSX Change Log

All notable changes are documented in this file.



## 0.3.3 - 2023-08-23

Allow all known 2021 and 2022 versions. This will introduce some unknown xpaths that we hope to id in a future update. 


## 0.3.2 - 2022-07-19

Allow version 2020v1.1

## 0.3.1 - 2022-07-19

Removed IRSX' ability to retrieve filings from an S3 bucket. 
Add irsx_retrieve to retrieve an entire year of filings from IRS' new location. This is experimental, it's not clear
how IRS will add additional zip files, or why the number per year is so inconsistent. Also modify the irsx index command to 
retrieve index files from the new locations. 





## 0.2.13 - 2022-05-31

Allow version 2020v4.2 to run. Xpaths newly added in 2020 (very few) are still unsupported, but everything else appears to work.


## 0.2.13 - 2021-07-21

Add experimental support for schemas for TY 2020. IRSx will process these now; gathering info about missing xpaths.

## 0.2.12 - 2020-10-23

Bugfix.  

## 0.2.11 - 2020-10-23

Bugfix. 


## 0.2.10 - 2020-10-23

Add support for 2018 schemas through 2018v3.2 and 2018v3.3. Add experimental support for 2019v5.0 through 2019v5.3. 


## 0.2.9 - 2019-10-09

Add support for 2018 schemas through 2018v3.1

## 0.2.8 - 2019-09-15

Update metadata submodule

## 0.2.7 - 2018-08-22

Point to updated 990-xml-metadata repo, which includes xpaths for Tax Years 2017 and 2018. 

## 0.2.6 - 2018-08-22

Allow version 2018v3.0 filings to be processed, these are also in production but were omitted in 0.2.4.


## 0.2.5 - 2018-08-20

Allow xml namespacing, as exhibited by 201940149349301304_public. 

## 0.2.4 - 2018-08-20

Allow version 2018v3.1 filings to be processed. A few new metadata lines will need to be added once I've processed the .xsd files.


## 0.2.3 

PR to accept file cache location as env var - https://github.com/jsfenfen/990-xml-reader/pull/20

## 0.2.2 - 2018-05-09

- Incorporate metadata changes; still need better approach

## 0.2.1 - 2018-05-04

- Updates in metadata to cover 2017; updates downstream. 

## 0.2.0 - 2018-05-03

- Depend on metadata as a submodule instead of as a directory. 
- Change in metadata; instead of a semicolon-delimited list of versions, files instead include version\_start and version\_end which includes the __year__ that a variable first appeared. The version_end is left blank unless the variable is no longer used.

## 0.1.1 - 2018-03-19

- Added the object_id to the .csv output
- Added IRSX\_SETTINGS\_LOCATION to allow: `from irs_reader.settings import IRSX_SETTINGS_LOCATION`

## 0.0.10 - 2018-03-15

- Initial release
